Codebasics Resume Challenge Series
The project Codebasics-Telecom challenge is a part of the current series by codebasics.io, which helps Data Analyst enthusiasts to showcase their skills and shine amongst others by adding them to your resume portfolio. 
In this repository, you will find the needed docs and images to ensure you are on the right track. You can visit their website for more insights and updates. 
I have also attached my pbix file, which you can download; make some changes and play with it. I'm ready for any changes you propose to insights and report/dashboard. 
Hope you will find it meaningful and help me become richer in terms of knowledge.
